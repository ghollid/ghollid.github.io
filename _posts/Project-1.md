In my project, I chose to explore the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.  I built 
a variety of functions with various endpoints and ran some exploratory data 
analysis.  Much of the output from my functions depends on what movies are put 
in, in terms of statistical importance, as well as on the goals of the user.  
Many of the results do not necessarily mean too much on their own (you’d have
to be truly looking for a specific answer about some select movies), but some 
were interesting in terms of potential broader trends that could be observed in 
large sets of movies.  For example, EDA seemed to point towards higher 
grossing movies being of certain genres (as one might expect) including 
action/adventure movies and animation movies, with comedy, drama, and horror 
movies falling at the lower end of the scale.  I also looked at the “efficiency”
of a movie (how much money they made per minute run time).  This is mostly a 
nonsensical analysis but was interesting to explore what movies and genres made
more by the minute.  

In terms of the process behind this project, I began by looking at examples are 
trying to choose an API that both interested me and made sense for the tasks at 
hand.  After choosing, I dd have some difficulty in initially connecting to the 
API and using JSONlite to access the raw data.  However, I found that after you
figure it out once, it flows much easier from there.  I think the most difficult
part was constructing meaningful functions out of the limited data that I had 
access to.  If I were to repeat this project, I would pick a different API, 
perhaps that interested me a bit less.  I think the data was there, but once 
you got a couple of endpoints in, there is only so much you can do with movie 
data.  Overall though, I think this project gave me good experience working 
with and troubleshooting an API and manipulating and visualizing data.
