# About Me!
Hello!  My name is Grace Holliday.  I graduated from **Clemson University** in *May 2022* with a BS in Biological Sciences.  I am currently in the MS Statistics program at **North Carolina State University** set to graduate in *August 2023*.  Here, I will blog about what I learn about data science and the use of R to explore data science topics throughout the semester.  

## Previous Research Experiences
I do have previous research experiences through which I have utilized R for the development of projects related to evolutionary biology:
1. **2021 Clemson University Summer CI + UR Program** - This project explores the evolution of body form diversity in fishes using an existing morphological dataset collected from specimens at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. It began with a deep literature survey focusing on the evolution of elongation in fishes and its ecological consequences. We then generated indices from morphological measurements that characterize elongation including fineness ratio and collated ecological data from FishBase that was then used to conduct phylogenetic comparative analyses using R.
2. **SICB 2022 Annual Meeting: DPCB Best Student Presentation: David & Marvalee Wake Award Talk Session** - Evolution of body elongation in fishes and its ecological consequences - Presented in form of a talk at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Annual Meeting 2022 within the Division of Phylogenetics and Comparative Biology Best Student Award session.
3. **SICB 2022 Annual Meeting: Morphological Evolution I Talk Session** - The (co)evolution of defensive morphology and venom in catfishes - Presented in form of a talk at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology Annual Meeting 2022.  

Here is a photo of a poster based on one of these projects :) :
